# RusLyricsFreq
### a small NLP project that forms a word cloud of the most frequent words in the whole discography of any Russian artist.

+ Python nltk library (stop words for Russian) to perform needed NLP
+ re module
+ pandas
+ wordcloud
+ matplotlyb

the project was initially written in Python in Jupiter and saved as .py code.

the final output looks like a colourful word cloud:
